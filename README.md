# FaceHole
Filling in holes of Facebook's Graph API.

This project aims to fill in any functionality that might be lacking in Facebook's Graph API. There probably aren't too many holes, but this was inspired by finding out that the API couldn't add a public key programmatically.

The methods for accomplishing this will probably change over time as I become more familiar with Graph and as maybe Facebook fills in these holes themselves, but it might have some utility.

Please feel free to contribute and let me know if you've found any other holes that need filling.
